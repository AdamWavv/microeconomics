# Microeconomics
 The project consists of specification, estimation (modeling should be performed in the STATA package) and verification of a microeconometric model for a selected variable – based on a sufficiently large set of microdata.


# Course Program

The course covers econometric methods focused on microdata. The subject matter is of significant practical importance and highly relevant to economic sciences (notably, the 2000 Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to J. Heckman and D. McFadden). The syllabus includes topics related to modeling qualitative and limited dependent variables.

# Course Objective

The objective of the course is to develop the ability to specify, estimate, and validate econometric models based on microdata.

# Project Guidelines

The project involves the specification, estimation (the modeling must be conducted using the STATA software package), and validation of a microeconometric model for a selected variable, based on a sufficiently large set of microdata. Techniques discussed during the course must be applied. The data may come from various sources. The only thematic restriction: projects analyzing determinants of happiness or similar topics will not be accepted.

# Project Description Requirements

The project report should not exceed 15 pages of standard A4 format and must include:

- **Introduction**: presenting the research problem (explaining why it is worth addressing), along with a literature review on the chosen topic (3–4 academic articles).
- **Data Analysis**: describing the dataset used for modeling, including the data source, variable definitions, and statistical properties. The data should be relatively recent.
- **Method/Model Selection**: providing reasons for choosing a particular method or model.
- **Presentation and Interpretation of Results**: preceded by a brief report on the estimation and validation outcomes. The number of tables should be minimized in favor of textual interpretation.
- **Conclusion**: summarizing the entire project, providing recommendations for application, and suggesting possible extensions and directions for further research.
- **STATA Code**.
- **Bibliography**: listing all references used in the project.
